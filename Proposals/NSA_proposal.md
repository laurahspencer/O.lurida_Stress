Transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic adaptability to dual climate stressors in oysters

      Background: The ecologic and economic void left by the near collapse of Ostrea lurida, 
the Northeast Pacific Ocean’s only native oyster, has spurred major efforts to restore populations 
along its historic distribution from Alaska to Baja California.  Restoration groups cite the 
beneficial capacity that oysters, characterized as ecosystem engineers, provide via attachment 
substrate, habitat for intertidal and juvenile species, biofiltration and denitrification, and as a key 
food source for birds and intertidal predators.  O. lurida also has enormous economic potential, as 
indicated by historic harvest records in Willapa Bay, WA, which at its peak exported over one 
hundred million oysters annually compared to less than twelve hundred today.  While shoreline 
enhancement and seeding projects are making headway, there is growing concern that changing 
ocean conditions further threaten existing populations and may stymie restoration investments.
      Ocean acidification (OA) has garnered particular attention in response to evidence that 
farmed oysters are already exhibiting negative effects,  and its coupling with climate-related 
temperature shifts requires interconnected research to better predict future scenarios. A broadening 
body of work indicates that low pH and high temperature negatively affect fertilization and early 
life stages of many marine invertebrates. , ,  In the case of O. lurida, temperature is known to 
drive the timing of gametogenesis and spawning. ,  Research has also explored shifts in survival 
and growth rates, observing that O. lurida larvae exposed to low pH display poor shell 
development in multiple life stages,  and larvae reared at low pH are more susceptible to 
predation by invasive snails.  
      Perhaps most importantly, marine invertebrate genomes have been shown to be highly 
polymorphic. , ,  Zang et al. (2012), for example, found the Crassostrea gigas genome to 
contain “an extensive set of genes [that respond to] environmental stress.”  The newly emerging 
field of epigenetics also suggests that adult responses to environment conditions can be passed on 
to offspring.  Indeed, offspring of Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata) exposed to 
elevated pCO2 during reproductive conditioning performed better in OA conditions compared to 
larvae of broodstock conditioned in ambient pCO2 levels, likely due to increased standard 
metabolic rate.  Considering their capacity for rapid genetic drift due to the Sweepstakes 
Reproductive Success hypothesis,  oysters such as O. lurida may contain the adaptive plasticity 
in the face of climate stressors due to differential gene expression, rapid natural selection, or both. 
Still unknown, however, are the underlying mechanisms of this epigenetic response, and how they 
might be affected by both high pCO2 and temperature, dual climate stressors that are projected to 
occur simultaneously due to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide. 
      In response to these data gaps, this proposal seeks to elucidate the mechanisms of 
plasticity in O. lurida in response to both elevated temperature and dissolved CO2 by assessing 
differential gene expression of broodstock conditioned in climate stressors, subsequent larval 
production and survival, and transgenerational inheritance by assessing genetic and epigenetic 
marker selection. This will be the first study exploring mechanisms underlying potential 
differential gene expression and transgenerational inheritance in oysters reared in dual climate 
stressors, and will have implications on future community-level resilience in O. lurida, as well 
as other bivalves with similar genetic polymorphism and adaptive response. 
      Research Support: This project will be executed under the advisement of Dr. Steven 
Roberts at the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences. I will 
collaborate with Puget Sound Restoration Fund staff at the Kenneth K. Chew Center for Shellfish 
Research and Restoration to raise O. lurida in the proposed treatments. The hatchery is a research 
hub, and can provide infrastructure, research space, live algae, and the CO2 injector system, which 
has been in experimental operation since March 2016. Not provided by the Chew Center are 
filters, and a method of maintaining desired seawater temperatures. If awarded, the Melbourne 
R. Carriker Student Research Grant will provide the funds needed to purchase cartridge filters 
and submersible heaters to maintain independent replicate treatment regimes.
       Hypotheses: O. lurida broodstock conditioned in elevated pCO2 and temperature will 
(H1) differentially express genes compared to oysters reared in ambient conditions due to altered 
histone modification or DNA methylation; (H2) produce a greater percentage of larvae that are 
more resilient to the dual climate stressors, as determined by growth rate and survival; (H3) 
transfer heritable, climate stress related epigenetic markers to larval offspring.

 	Research Plan: In early winter 600 O. lurida hatchery-born (F1) individuals from the 
same, pooled lineage will be randomly selected from the previous breeding season and divided 
into separate flow-through seawater culture tanks. Triplicates of four treatment regimes (Table1) 
will reflect ambient and projected winter water temperatures and dissolved pCO2 . 
Desired temperatures will be maintained using submersible aquarium heaters; desired pCO2 levels 
will be maintained using the Kenneth K. Chew’s ocean acidification experimental CO2 injector 
and aerator system, and monitored via Honeywell Durafet pH sensors. After four months, all 
culture tank temperatures will be increased relative to their “base” winter temperature to mimic 
seasonal temperature increase, allowing for spring spawn; dissolved CO2 will remain constant at 
treatment levels. All groups will be fed identical cocktails of live algae and microbial 
communities will be controlled via antibiotic treatments. Larvae from each treatment group will 
be collected, divided and reared through settlement in four treatment regimes (Table 2). Post 
settlement, oysters will be grown off-dock in ambient conditions, until the following season when 
the experiment will be repeated with these experimentally produced F2 individuals to explore 
multi-generational effects.

      Significance: This research will explore new territory of O. lurida epigenetic and 
transgenerational inheritance of climate change stressor resiliency, and will inform further 
climate-related reproduction research in other species of wild and farmed bivalves such as 
Crassostrea virginica and Crassostrea gigas. Secondly, a deeper understanding of CO2 and 
temperature related drivers in O. lurida reproduction will help to elucidate its vulnerability or 
adaptability to the climate model predictions of steadily decreasing ocean pH and increasing 
temperatures, and could have profound implications for wild community-level population 
dynamics. Thirdly, knowledge of adaptive capacity via differential gene expression and 
transgenerational effects would inform hatchery breeders to select for OA-resilient oysters, or to 
induce an immune-like response by exposing broodstock to future climate conditions. Results 
from this study would need to be considered in ecological models, and restoration groups could 
refine selection processes for shoreline enhancement and seeding processes, or amplify efforts in 
bays with variable pH and temperature swings to allow for natural selection.
