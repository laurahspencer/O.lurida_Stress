2. Is this a new project or one in progress? What is the name of the experiment?

New project (no prior publications), but there is some ongoing laboratory work associated with the project, and there will be an associated publication in the future. The “name” of the project is - Carryover effects in the Olympia oyster 


3. What are the top 3 main points you want people to understand about this research? (please provide non-technical answers).

 - 1) Warming and acidifying oceans negatively influence many marine species. 
 - 2) However, some species that live in extreme environments such as the intertidal may be more resilient than others to these changes. Furthermore, some species may be capable of passing on memories of harsh conditions to offspring, making them more capable of surviving in similarly harsh environments. 
 - 3) We found that Olympia oyster adults were relatively resilient to acidification and warming when exposed during the winter. Most interestingly, we found evidence that adult exposure to low pH can benefit offspring by improving survival. 


4. Why is this study of interest to the public?

For marine organisms that support ecosystems and industries, such as oysters, it is critical to determine which species are most resilient to ocean change. Understanding how and why some species, such as the Olympia oyster, may tolerate ocean acidification and warming helps us decide where to focus conservation resources, and how to improve growing methods.
